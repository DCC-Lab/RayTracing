# RayTracing
This code aims to provide a simple ray tracing module for calculating various properties of optical paths (object, image, aperture stops, field stops).  It makes use of ABCD matrices and does not consider aberrations (spherical or chromatic). It is not a package to do "Rendering in 3D with raytracing".  

The code has been developed first for teaching purposes and is used in my "[Optique](https://itunes.apple.com/ca/book/optique/id949326768?mt=11)" Study Notes (french only), but also for actual use in my research. I have made no attempts at making high performance code.  Readability and simplicity of usage is the key here. It is a single module with only a few files, and only `matplotlib` as a dependent module.

The module defines `Ray` ,  `Matrix`, `MatrixGroup` and `ImagingPath` as the main elements.  Matrix and MatrixGroup are either one or a sequence of many matrices into which rays will propagate. ImagingPath is also a seuqnece of element, with an object at the front edge.  Specific subclasses of `Matrix` exists: `Space`, `Lens` and `Aperture`. Finally, a ray fan is a collection of rays, originating from a given point with a range of angles.

## Getting started
You need `matplotlib`, which is a fairly standard Python module. If you do not have it,  installing [Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/download/) is your best option. You should choose Python 3.7 or later.

You create an `ImagingPath`, which you then populate with optical elements such as Space, Lens or Aperture. You can then adjust the imaging path properties (object height for instance) and display in matplotlib.

This will show you a few examples of things you can do:

```shell
python -m raytracing
```

In order to be able to *import* the `raytracing` module, you must have one of the following:

1. The module `raytracing` in the same directory as your file
2. or The path to `raytracing` added to `sys.path` manually or through the command-line with PYTHONPATH.

In your code, (such as the `test.py` or `demo.py`  files), you would do this:

```python
from raytracing import *

path = ImagingPath()
path.append(Space(d=10))
path.append(Lens(f=5, diameter=2.5))
path.append(Space(d=12))
path.append(Lens(f=7))
path.append(Space(d=10))
path.display()
```

You may obtain help by typing (interactively): `help(Matrix)`, `help(Ray)`,`help(ImagingPath)`

```python
python
>>> help(Matrix)
Help on class Matrix in module raytracing:

class Matrix(builtins.object)
 |  A matrix and an optical element that can transform a ray or another matrix.
 |  
 |  The general properties (A,B,C,D) are defined here. The operator "*" is 
 |  overloaded to allow simple statements such as:
 |  
 |  M2 = M1 * ray  
 |  or 
 |  M3 = M2 * M1
 |  
 |  In addition apertures are considered and the physical length is 
 |  included to allow simple management of the ray tracing.
 |  
 |  Methods defined here:
 |  
 |  __init__(self, A, B, C, D, physicalLength=0, apertureDiameter=inf, label='')
 |     Initialize self.  See help(type(self)) for accurate signature.
 |  
 |  __mul__(self, rightSide)
 |     Operator overloading allowing easy to read matrix multiplication 
 |      
 |     For instance, with M1 = Matrix() and M2= Matrix(), one can write M3 = M1*M2.
 |     With r = Ray(), one can apply the M1 transform to a ray with r = M1*r
 |  
 |  __str__(self)
 |     String description that allows the use of print(Matrix())
 |  
 |  displayHalfHeight(self)
 |      A reasonable height for display purposes for an element, whether it is infinite or 
```

## Examples

You can run the module directly with `python -m raytracing`Â or look at the [examples](./examples) directory.

You can run `demo.py` to see a variety of systems, `illuminator.py` to see a Kohler illuminator, and `invariant.py` to see an example of the role of lens diameters to determine the field of view.
