# Abstract

1. For students and non optical designer
2. Simple optical design, 0th order: object images, but apertures, field stops and invariant
3. Simple Python library for tracing rays, few dependencies
4. Documented code, simplicity before power, yet very powerful.

Students need to know certain system properties to succeed

Of course, when needed eventually many dig in and figure it out.

Not everyone actually digs in

It is a waste of time to figure out the question, let alone the answer
