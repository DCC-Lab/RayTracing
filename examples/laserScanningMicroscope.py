"""
In a laser scanning system, the scanning components define 
the covered field-of-view (FOV) at the sample plane. Here, 
we show a one-dimensional example with a polygonal mirror
of 36 facets that rotates rapidly to scan
the beam along the horizontal direction. It produces a meachnical 
sweep of 10 degrees, or 0.1750 rad, between each facets. 
Therefore, the laser beam covers a total optical scan angle of 20 degrees.
In the following example, the object is considered to be the
laser beam at the polygonal mirror plane. 
The output profile shows on its x-axis the width of the FOV under the objective.
