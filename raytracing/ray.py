class Ray:
    """A vector and a light ray as transformed by ABCD matrices.

    The Ray() has a height (y) and an angle with the optical axis (theta).
    It also has a position (z) initially at z=0, the diameter of the aperture at that point
    when it propagated through, and a marker if it has been blocked by the
    aperture.

    Simple static functions are defined to obtain a group of rays: fans
    originate from the same height but sweep a range of angles; fan groups
    are fans originating from different heights.

    Parameters
    ----------
    y : float
        Initial height of the ray. (Default=0)
    theta : float
        Initial angle of the ray. (Default=0)

    Attributes
    ----------
    z : float
        Position of the ray along the optical axis. Initialized at 0.
    apertureDiameter : float
        The diameter of any blocking aperture at the present position z. Initialized at +Inf.
    isBlocked : bool
        Whether or not the ray was blocked by an aperture. Initialized to False.
