"""A simple module for ray tracing with ABCD matrices.
https://github.com/DCC-Lab/RayTracing

Create an ImagingPath(), append matrices (optical elements or other
group of elements), and then display(). This helps determine of
course simple things like focal length of compound systems,
object-image, etc... but also the aperture stop, field stop, field
of view and any clipping issues that may occur.

When displaying the result with an ImagingPath(), the  objectHeight,
fanAngle, and fanNumber are used if the field of view is not
defined. You may adjust the values to suit your needs in ImagingPath().

Create a LaserPath() to analyse gaussian beams using the complex radius
of curvature q and the same matrices.

The class hierarchy can be seen on http://webgraphviz.com with the
following description:

digraph G {
   rankdir="LR";

    subgraph elements {
        "Matrix" -> "Space"
        "Matrix" -> "Lens"
        "Matrix" -> "Aperture"
        "Matrix" -> "ThickLens"
        "Matrix" -> "CurvedMirror"
        "Matrix" -> DielectricInterface
        "Matrix" -> "MatrixGroup"
        "ThickLens" -> "DielectricSlab"

        "MatrixGroup" -> "AchromaticDoubletLens"
        "AchromaticDoubletLens" -> "thorlabs.part#"
        "AchromaticDoubletLens" -> "eo.part#"
        "MatrixGroup" -> "Objective"
        "Objective" -> "olympus.part#"
    }

    subgraph mathview {
        "Matrix" -> "MatrixGroup"
        "MatrixGroup" -> ImagingPath
    }

}

To use the package, either:
1) pip install raytracing
or
2) copy to the raytracing package to the directory where you want to use it
or
3) python setup.py install from the source code directory
