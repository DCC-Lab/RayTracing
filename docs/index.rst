RayTracing
======================================
This code aims to provide a simple ray tracing module for calculating various
properties of optical paths (object, image, aperture stops, field stops). It
makes use of ABCD matrices and does not consider aberrations (spherical or
chromatic). Since it uses the ABCD formalism (or Ray matrices, or Gauss
matrices) it can perform tracing of rays and gaussian laser beams.
